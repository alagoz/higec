# HiGEC
HiGEC: Hierarchy Generation and Extended Classification Framework
HiGEC is an open-source framework for advancing multi-class classification through automated class hierarchy generation (HG) and extended hierarchy exploitation (HE). The framework introduces novel HC+ and HC+F schemes that combine global and local classification strategies to improve performance.

HiGeC is evaluated on 115 multi-class datasets, demonstrating significant improvements over traditional flat classification (FC) and one-vs-all (OVA) approaches, particularly with advanced classifiers like XGBoost.
